<h1>Learn CSS Layout Practice</h1>
<p> Practicing some CSS from the <a href="www.learnlayout.com">Learn Layout</a> site.</p>

<div class="paragraph-block">
  <p>This div is the standard block-level element. A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. Other common block-level elements are p and form, and new in HTML5 are header, footer, section, and more.</p>
</div>

<div id="main">
Setting the <b>width</b> of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container to the left and right. <b>( margin: 0 auto)</b> Then, you can set the left and right margins to auto to horizontally center that element within its container. The element will take up the width you specify, then the remaining space will be split evenly between the two margins.
</div>

<div id="main-max-width">
The only problem occurs when the browser window is narrower than the width of your element. The browser resolves this by creating a horizontal scrollbar on the page. <b>Using max-width instead of width</b> in this situation will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on mobile. Resize this page to check it out!
</div>

<h2>THE BOX MODEL</h2>
<div class="simple">
This div has a width of 500px, and margin of 20px auto.
</div>

<div class="fancy">
This div also has a width of 500px, and margin of 20px auto, but has padding and border width.
</div>

<h3>BOX-SIZING</h3>
<p>box-model considered unintuitive so box-sizing was created. When you set <b>box-sizing: border-box;</b> on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width.</p>
<p>Some people want all elements on all their pages to work this way so people use the universal styling with "*" for box-sizing. Use the <b>-webkit-</b>and<b>-moz-</b> prefixes since it is new and not standard across all browsers</p>

<div class="simple box-size">
This div is the same same as the "simple" div with box-size added to it.
</div>

<div class="fancy box-size">
This div is the same same as the "fancy" div with box-size added to it.
</div>

<h2> POSITION</h2>
<h5>static</h5>
<div class="static">
<b>static</b> is the default value. An element with <b>position: static;</b> is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be <i>not positioned</i> and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be <i>positioned</i>.
</div>

<h5>relative</h5>
<div class="relative1">
<b>relative</b> behaves the same was as <b>static</b> unless you add some extra properties.
</div>

<div class="relative2">
Setting the <b>top, right, bottom, and left</b> properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
</div>

<h5>fixed</h5>
A <b>fixed</b> element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the <b>top, right, bottom, and left</b> properties are used.

<div class="fixed">
This is a <b>fixed div</b>. It doesn't leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
</div>

<h5>absolute</h5>
<p>The trickiest position value. <b>absolute</b> behaves liked <b>fixed</b> except relative to <i>the nearest positioned ancestor</i> instead of relative to the viewport.</p>
<p>If an absolutely-positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and still moves along with page scrolling. Remember, a "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except <b>static</b></p>

<div class="relative">
This element is <b>relatively-positioned</b>. If this element was <b>position: static;</b> its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.

  <div class="absolute">
  This is a child element of the outer box. It is <b>absolutely-positioned</b>. It's positioned relative to its parent.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- FLOATS & CLEARS-->

<h2>Floats</h2>
Float is intended for wrapping text around images. The image is floated to the right.

<div class="content">
  <p>
  <img class="img-float" src="apple.jpg">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
  tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
  quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
  consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse
  cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non
  proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>
</div>

<h3>clear</h3>
The <b>clear</b> property is important for controlling behavior of <b>float</b>.
<br>
<h6>example 1</h6>

  <div class="box">
  I feel like I'm floating!
  </div>

  <div class="section1">
    <p>This section1 div is actually <b>after the div</b>. However, since the <b>box div is floated to the left</b>, this is what happens: the text in the section is floated around the div and the section surrounds the whole thing. What if we wanted the section to actually appear after the floated element?</p>
  </div>

<h6>example 2</h6>
  <div class="box">
  I feel like I'm floating!
  </div>

  <div class="section2">
    <p>Using <b>clear: left;</b> we have now moved this section down below the floated div. You use the value <b>left</b> to <b>clear</b> elements floated to the left. You can also <b>clear right</b>and <b>both</b>.</p>
  </div>

<h3>clearfix hack</h3>

<div class="section-clearfix">
<img class="img-clear" src="apple.jpg">
Uh oh...this image is taller than the element containing it, and it's floated, so it's overflowing outside the container!
</div>

<br>
We can fix this using the <b>clearfix hack</b>.


<div class="clearfix">
<img class="img-clear" src="apple.jpg">
This uses the <b>.clearfix</b> class  and <b>overflow: auto;</b>...Much better!
</div>

<br>

<p>
  <a href="pages/page3.html">This is the same example in positions, but using floats instead</a>
</p>

<!-- PERCENTS -->
<h2>PERCENT WIDTH</h2>
Percent is a measurement unit <b>relative to the containing block</b>. It's great for <b>images</b>.

<!-- INLINE BLOCK -->
<h2>INLINE-BLOCK</h2>

<h5>Using float and clear</h5>
<div class="box">
<span class="label">"box"</span>
  I'm floating!
</div>
<div class="box">
<span class="label">"box"</span>
  I'm floating!
</div>
<div class="box">
<span class="label">"box"</span>
  I'm floating!
</div>
<div class="box">
<span class="label">"box"</span>
  I'm floating!
</div>
<div class="box">
<span class="label">"box"</span>
  I'm floating!
</div>

<div class="after-box">
<span class="label">"after-box"</span>
I'm using <b>clear</b> so I don't float next to the above boxes.
</div>

<h5>Using inline-block</h5>

<div class="box2">
<span class="label">"box2"</span>
I'm an in-line block
</div>
<div class="box2">
<span class="label">"box2"</span>
I'm an in-line block
</div>
<div class="box2">
<span class="label">"box2"</span>
I'm an in-line block
</div>
<div class="box2">
<span class="label">"box2"</span>
I'm an in-line block
</div>
<div class="box2">
<span class="label">"box2"</span>
I'm an in-line block
</div>

<div class="after-box2">
I don't need to use <b>clear</b> for this box.
</div>
